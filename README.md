## A true full stack developer's oath

As my lecturer said; Full stack development is extremely hard, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier

- I will have my browser developer console open all the time
- I will use the network tab of the browser dev tools to ensure that frontend and backend are communicating as I expect
- I will constantly keep an eye on the state of the server to make sure that the data sent there by the frontend is saved as I expect
- I will keep an eye on the database: does the backend save data there in the right format
- I will progress in small steps
- I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code and the tests behave and to help pinpoint problems
- If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything is still working
- If a test does not pass, I make sure that the tested functionality for sure works in the application
- When I ask for help in the course Discord or Telegram channel or elsewhere I formulate my questions properly
